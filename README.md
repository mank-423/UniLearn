# UniLearn v1.0
Ideation of the app(Ongoing project)
1. Working on Login completed(using localStorage for now to hold on to login for 1 hr)
2. Working on UI still going on
3. Looking for a way to host PDF files and other files(Idea of using GridFS), but for v1 using iframe and link of Google Drive

To run the project:
1. git clone https://github.com/mank-423/UniLearn
2. cd UniLearn -> npm run start(development server for UI)
3. As the backend is inside UniLearn folder, so for backend -> cd UniLearn -> cd server -> nodemon index.js or node index.js
4. Now the server is spinned and running along with UI.
