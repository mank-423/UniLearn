# UniLearn v1.0
A project which focuses on making a learning portal for core subjects of university students alongwith a touch of notion, for organized study.

Ideation of the app(Ongoing project)
1. Working on Login completed(using localStorage for now to hold on to login for 1 hr)
2. Working on UI still in progress (Home and about page done)
3. Looking for a way to host PDF files and other files(Idea of using GridFS), but for v1 using iframe and link of Google Drive

To run the project:
1. git clone https://github.com/mank-423/UniLearn
2. cd UniLearn -> npm run start(development server for UI)
3. As the backend is inside UniLearn folder, so for backend -> cd UniLearn -> cd server -> nodemon index.js or node index.js
4. Now the server is spinned and running along with UI.

Resources that I want to use:
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2YZRa3pMac&t=130s (GridFS tutorial)
2. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gridfs-making-file-uploading-to-mongodb/ (GridFS freecodeCamp)
3. https://www.react-spring.dev/docs/components/parallax (Parallax library react docs)
4. https://codesandbox.io/s/h1rrv (It's implmentation for vertical parallax)
5. [Inclusion of a timer on subjects page](https://dev.to/yuridevat/how-to-create-a-timer-with-react-7b9)
